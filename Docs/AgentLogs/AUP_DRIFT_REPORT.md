# AUP Drift Report

Agent: ARCHITECTURAL_AUP_INTEGRITY_AUDITOR
Status: LOOP 1 COMPLETE - PRECISION PATCHED, COMPILE BLOCKED BY PROJECT REFERENCES

## Authority

- AUP must remain authoritative in 64-bit/int64-sector form until the last presentation conversion.
- Distance triggers must subtract in double precision before squared-length checks.
- Rebase shifts require atomic processing and 300-frame snap-fence telemetry.
- Low-tier float fallback is only allowed for distant entities after explicit tier and distance gates.

## Loop 1 Findings

- `Docs/Tasks/CURRENT_BATCH.md` did not contain this agent prompt on initial extraction or the Task 4 re-extraction.
- Mandatory scan `rg "\(float3\).*AUP|AupOffset|universe"` ran. Runtime findings include fluid/vector-noise AUP float offsets, GPU scatter AUP offset storage, and the core AUP runtime-position constructor.
- `AbsoluteUniversePosition.FromRuntimePosition` was the authority leak: it converted runtime to absolute via `Vector3` before `double3` sector quantization.
- `AUPDirection` normalized after a premature float cast.
- `PlayerKinematicsRuntime` publishes a sync fence every 300 fast ticks and writes hash telemetry.
- `ProceduralOreSpawner` preserves sector hash entropy by folding low/high `long` bits into the uint job seed; no `(int)SectorHash` truncation was found.
- `Hecton8.Core.AUP` asmdef does not exist. Existing `Hecton8.Core` and contracts asmdefs still depend on UnityEngine; isolation remains pending.

## Code Changes

- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/HectonFloatingOrigin.cs`: added `_totalOffsetDouble`, `CurrentTotalOffsetDouble`, and `ToAbsoluteUniversePositionDouble3`; shift accumulation now preserves committed offset in double.
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/World/PersistentWorldRegistry.cs`: `AbsoluteUniversePosition.FromRuntimePosition` now uses the double AUP conversion path.
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/World/AUPMath.cs`: `AUPDirection` now computes length in double and uses `math.rsqrt` before the final float3 output.
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/HectonFloatingOrigin.cs`: drift watchdog reports max AUP/runtime error and uses `math.rcp` for anchor velocity fallback.
- `Assets/_Project/Scripts/CrashTelemetryBuffer.cs`: added `ReportAupMaxDriftError` and ring-buffer write path.

## Verification

- Re-ran mandatory AUP scan; remaining float AUP offset hits are primarily presentation/shader fluid/scatter lanes and are recorded for later domain owners.
- `dotnet build Hecton8.Core.csproj`: failed with 131 existing missing-reference errors, including `Hecton8.Environment.Fluids`, `Hecton8.Audio.Virtualization`, `Hecton8.Physics.CCD`, and `Hecton8.Core.Scheduling`.
- `dotnet build Assembly-CSharp.csproj`: timed out after 120s; timed-out build process and MSBuild servers were stopped.
- Unity MCP script validation: unavailable (`no_unity_session`).

## Evidence Queue

- Continue scan of AI/Biome proximity callsites for silent `float3` seeds and presentation-only exceptions.
- Verify AUP shift consumer coverage across fluid, voxel, world streaming, scatter, foveated simulation, and GPR.
- Decide whether a future batch may introduce a true `Hecton8.Core.AUP` asmdef; current file placement prevents UnityEngine isolation.
